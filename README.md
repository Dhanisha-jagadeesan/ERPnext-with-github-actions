## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting up an ERPNext application in a Dockerized environment using GitHub Actions. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to ERPNext, this guide is designed to simplify the deployment process on a fresh Ubuntu server.

## Prerequisites
You need a clean Ubuntu server. We recommend an AWS EC2 instance with specifications such as `t3:small type` boasting 2GB of RAM and 30GB of storage. Throughout the tutorial, we will explore two methods of server authorization: SSH authentication and password authentication.

### Server Authentication:
In this particular setup, we'll focus on server `authentication using a username and password`. This method is chosen for its simplicity, making it accessible to users at various skill levels.

## Getting started 
### Fork this Repository:
To start installation, fork üçΩ this repo:

### Define secrets variables in actions secrets and variables:
In a GitHub Actions workflow, you can define these variables as secrets. Secrets provide a way to store sensitive information, and they are encrypted and only exposed to runners during the execution of your workflow. Here's how you can define these secrets:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on `Settings` in the upper-right corner.
In the left sidebar, click on `Secrets`
Click on `New repository secret`.
Name the secret as SSH_HOST and enter the server IP address.

#### SSH_HOST, SSH_USER, SSH_PASSWORD:
Create two more secrets: SSH_USER, SSH_HOST and SSH_PASSWORD for the server username and password.

#### ADMIN_PASSWORD:
Create a new secret named ADMIN_PASSWORD and set the value to the administrator password for the ERP app.

#### ERP_SITE_NAME:
Create a new secret named ERP_SITE_NAME and set the value to your desired ERP site name (e.g., erpsite.local).

#### MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ROOT_USER:
Create two secrets: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and MYSQL_ROOT_USER for the MariaDB root user password and username.
